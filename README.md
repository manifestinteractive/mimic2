Mimic Trainer
---

This fork of [Mycrofts Mimic II](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mimic2) is built specifically for my personal project [Mimic My Voice](https://github.com/manifestinteractive/mimic-my-voice) and is brought in automatically during that projects setup process.

What's Different
===

> Here are the changes I have made in this repository, some of which I would consider to be breaking changes for those used to the original project.

- [X] Refactored to work with [Mimic My Voice](https://github.com/manifestinteractive/mimic-my-voice) Automated Setup Process
- [X] Updated Ports
- [X] Removed Param Debugging
- [X] Updated Docker Build Instructions
- [X] Removed Sample Content and Unused Documentation

So, you probably do not want THIS version of the Mimic II Trainer, unless you are a developer working with the [Mimic My Voice](https://github.com/manifestinteractive/mimic-my-voice) project.
